# Exercise 1 - Let's start

## Description

This exercise is quite similar to the number 1, but you
have to take the files from a folder instead of a single file

Write an hadoop program to solve the Word Count problem.

- Input: a HDFS folder containing textual files
- Output: number of occurrencies of each word appearing in the input file

Pay attention that the file can contain also words followed by comma or dot,
so you should remove them and count just the words

To check if your exercise succeded check if the number of words obtained
are doubled.
